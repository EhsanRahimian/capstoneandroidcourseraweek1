This is The CapStone Project for Android Developing Major in Vanderbilt University.
This app uses the Spotify public API, create an Android app which allows a user to search for albums.
Among the things the app dose: 

	•	Allows the user to search by album name
	•	Displaying 10 albums, with cover art and album name in some sort of scrolling view.
The API endpoint reference:
     https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/

The specific reference for search: 
     https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/
Also I used: https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=ten&type=album for this task.
In this app I used 2 Activity and RecyclerView and Adapter class.
